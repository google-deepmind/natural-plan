# NATURAL PLAN

Natural Plan is a realistic planning benchmark in natural language containing 3 key tasks: Trip Planning, Meeting Planning, and Calendar Scheduling. This repo contains the data for inference, and evaluation code on model responses.

## Installation
Create a python virtual env

```
python -m venv natural_plan

source natural_plan/bin/activate
```

and install the dependencies

```
pip install absl-py
```

## Usage

Prepare the data after model inferences, and run evaluation code:

```
python evaluate_trip_planning.py
python evaluate_meeting_planning.py
python evaluate_calendar_scheduling.py
```
